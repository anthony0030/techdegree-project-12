# Online Projects Portfolio

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/f4cb99b5c0ee48ab8ca4adceb8f5aa51)](https://www.codacy.com/app/anthony0030/techdegree-project-02?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=anthony0030/techdegree-project-02&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

In this project, I built an Online Projects Portfolio using React. I used [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can see a [running copy of my project on Github pages](https://anthony0030.github.io/techdegree-project-12) and on [my private server](https://veaudry.pro).

The project had a few requirements:

- it had to have at least four projects displayed
- it had to have contact details
- it had to have JavaScript Interactivity
- it had to be hosted online

## Instructions to run locally
