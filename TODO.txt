Hello Reviewer, 

Thank you for taking the time to review my project!

You can find the site live:
  1) On my private server at https://veaudry.pro
  2) On GitHub pages https://anthony0030.github.io/techdegree-project-12

I have added JS interactivity:
  1) In the header as a progress bar for the amount of page viewed.
  2) On the skill icons (HTML, CSS, JS, etc..) as a tool tip (some times a browser refresh is needed to activate it).
  3) On each project as a modal that activates with the press of a button on each project.
  4) The full page is a react APP.

The project suports the following commands (OSX):

1) npm run-script start                // Starts a development server on port 3000
2) HTTPS=true npm run-script start     // Starts a secure development server on port 3000
3) npm run-script deploy               // Deploys the page to GitHub pages (permissions needed)
4) npm run-script build                // Builds the page locally
4) npm run-script predeploy            // Builds the page locally
5) npm run-script test                 // Runs the test file (no tests in this file yet)
5) npm run-script eject                // Ejects the project from the build system


The Browser i used in development was Google chrome, but i also opened my project in the latest versions of Firefox and Safari.
I am aiming for an "exceeds" rating.

Thanks again for taking the time to review my project!

Have a great day,
Anthony
